# COVID-19 Cases Analysis (2020) - Power BI Project

# Overview
The COVID-19 Cases Analysis project for the year 2020 is a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using Microsoft Power BI and DAX queries. The primary objective of this project is to provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on various aspects, including day-wise cases count, call reasons, location-wise case count, first COVID-19 tests, and the employment status of individuals within the healthcare sector.

# Data Sources
The project relies on publicly available COVID-19 datasets and healthcare employment data. The datasets include information from reliable sources, ensuring data accuracy and integrity throughout the analysis. Data cleaning and transformation were performed to prepare the data for analysis within Microsoft Power BI.

# Power BI Dashboard
The project showcases its findings and insights through an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard. The following key visuals and analyses are presented:

1. Day-Wise Cases Count
The "Day-Wise Cases Count" visual provides a time series analysis of COVID-19 cases throughout the year 2020. Users can filter the data by date range to track trends and patterns over time, helping to understand the evolution of the pandemic.

2. Call Reasons Analysis
The "Call Reasons" visual offers a breakdown of the reasons for calls related to COVID-19. By categorizing call reasons, this analysis provides insights into the public's concerns and motivations for seeking medical assistance during the pandemic.

3. Location-Wise Case Count
The "Location-Wise Case Count" visual presents a geographical analysis of COVID-19 cases, allowing users to explore the spread of the virus across different regions. Users can zoom in and out of maps to focus on specific areas of interest.

4. First COVID Test Analysis
The "First COVID Test Analysis" visual explores the time intervals between when individuals first exhibited symptoms or sought medical attention and when they received their initial COVID-19 tests. This analysis helps in understanding the testing response time during the pandemic.

5. Employment in Healthcare
The "Employment in Healthcare" visual examines the employment status of individuals within the healthcare sector. It provides insights into the workforce's stability and response during a health crisis.

# Technologies Used
- Microsoft Power BI: Power BI was the primary tool for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- DAX Queries: Basic DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries were utilized to perform calculations and create custom measures for more in-depth analysis.
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Data preprocessing was carried out to ensure data quality and consistency.

# How to Use
The Power BI dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and accessible for stakeholders interested in understanding the COVID-19 pandemic's impact in 2020. Users can interact with the visuals, apply filters, and drill down for detailed insights.

# Conclusion
The COVID-19 Cases Analysis project for the year 2020, developed using Microsoft Power BI, offers valuable insights into the pandemic's various aspects. This project showcases the capabilities of Power BI in data visualization and analytics, providing an accessible platform for users to explore and gain insights from COVID-19 data.
